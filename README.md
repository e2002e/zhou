# zhou
redirector for rainycrack

This repository is a frontend, because I had deleted it in my wrath when I though my alogirthm did not work.  
It turns out to be very good after I spoted a stupid error and fixed it.  
Thanks to all that come here and clone it since I posted on kali and hashcat's forum, and sorry about the versatility of the project.  
As it is it will not change but if I find a fix to make odd character sets usable.  

You can find zhou under the name of rainycrack at https://github.com/e2002e/rainycrack  
And also a fork of john including the method at https://github.com/e2002e/john
